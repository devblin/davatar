The following code snippet is a JavaScript program that generates images according to the specific requirements. This program uses "strict mode" to enforce stricter parsing and error handling, and imports helper functions from other files. It also creates a class called "Davatar" that has a method called "generate" which takes in various parameters to customize the image. It then checks the size and text of the image using validation functions before proceeding to generate the image. The generated image is created using the canvas API and is returned as a data URL.

The class also has default values for the parameters in case they are not provided by the user. The method uses these parameters to set the font, text color, and background color of the image. It also calculates the position of the text on the canvas based on the size and font of the image.

Finally, the program exports an instance of the Davatar class as a module for use in other files.
