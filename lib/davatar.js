The Davatar class is used to generate an avatar image by taking in various parameters such as size, text, text color, background color, font family, and font weight. 

Parameters:
- size : the size of the image in pixels, default is 64px
- text : the text that will be displayed in the image, usually the initials of a person
- textColor : the color of the text, by default it will use a helper function to generate a random color
- backgroundColor : the color of the background, by default it will use a helper function to generate a random color
- fontFamily : the font family to be used in the image, by default it is set to Arial
- fontWeight : the font weight to be used in the image, by default it is set to 100

The class also uses helper functions from the "mainFunctions" and "validationFunctions" files to check and validate the parameters. The "createCanvas" function from the canvas library is used to create a canvas element with the specified size.

The generate method takes in the parameters and checks if the size and text are valid. If they are, it creates a canvas element and sets the background color. It then calculates the text position using the canvas size and sets the font, alignment, and color for the text. The image quality is set to high and the canvas is converted to a data URL, which is then returned as the final result.
